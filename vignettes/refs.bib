	abstract = {There has been considerable progress in the systemic treatment of cancer because of the rapid development and clinical application of molecular targeted agents. Although patients with a particular type and stage of cancer are often treated as a single group, more-specific therapy is being considered, as subsets of these patients who are more likely to benefit from treatment with particular agents are being identified. We previously introduced the concept of 'oncogene addiction' to explain how some cancers that contain multiple genetic, epigenetic, and chromosomal abnormalities are dependent on or 'addicted' to one or a few genes for both maintenance of the malignant phenotype and cell survival. Thus, reversal of only one or a few of these abnormalities can inhibit cancer cell growth and in some cases translate to improved survival rates. This review summarizes current experimental and clinical evidence for the concept of oncogene addiction and describes molecular mechanisms that may explain this phenomenon. In addition, we discuss how high-throughput screening methods, including gene-expression profiling and proteomics, and emerging methods for analyzing complex cellular networks can be used to identify the state of oncogene addiction, i.e. the {'Achilles'} heel,' in specific cancers. Finally, we discuss the use of molecular targeted agents in combination with other anticancer agents as a strategy to optimize therapy and prevent disease recurrence.},

Using stringent criteria to delineate this subset, we identified 189 genes (average of 11 per tumor) that were mutated at significant frequency. The vast majority of these genes were not known to be genetically altered in tumors and are predicted to affect a wide range of cellular functions, including transcription, adhesion, and invasion. These data define the genetic landscape of two human cancer types, provide new targets for diagnostic and therapeutic intervention, and open fertile avenues for basic research in tumor biology.},

Expression vectors containing the normal or mutated androgen receptor sequence were transfected into {COS} or Hela cells.

	abstract = {The growth of prostate cancer is androgen responsive, and androgen receptor {(AR)} is thought to play an important role in the development of this cancer. Recently, some reports demonstrated that {AR} gene mutations were detected in human prostate cancer tissues. We have previously reported that one of eight endocrine therapy-resistant prostate cancer cases showed {AR} gene mutation {[Suzuki} et al: J Steroid Biochem Mol Biol 46:759-765, 1993]. To further investigate structural abnormality of the {AR} in a large number of human prostate cancers, exons {B-H} encoding {DNA-and} hormone-binding domains were examined by single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis of polymerase chain reaction products and direct sequencing. Tissues surgically removed from 30 cases of stage B or C prostate cancer and from 22 cases of endocrine therapy-resistant cancers obtained at autopsy were used in the study. Three out of 22 cancer death cases (14\%) revealed {AR} gene mutations, one of which contained two different mutations-exon D in cancerous prostate and exon H in metastatic tissues. In the other two cases, {AR} gene mutations in exon H were found in metastatic tissues. All three cases in metastatic tissues showed the same mutation at codon 877 {(877Thr--{\textgreater}Ala).} In stage B or C cancer tissues and the other cancer death samples, no {AR} mutation was detected. The mutation in exon H was identical to that reported in a human prostate cancer cell line, {LNCaP.} These results indicate that {AR} gene mutation scarcely occurs in the early stage of prostate cancer and that the mutation is found in relation to endocrine therapy resistance. Two patients with an {AR} gene mutation at codon 877 revealed a remarkable fall in prostate-specific antigen after withdrawal of antiandrogen. Data on the other case were not available. These results indicate that a codon 877 mutation in the {AR} gene in advanced prostate cancer evokes the antiandrogen withdrawal syndrome. To our knowledge, this report is the first description of relationship between an {AR} mutation at codon 877 and the antiandrogen withdrawal syndrome.},

Compared with steroidal agonists for the androgen receptor {(AR)} (e.g. dihydrotestosterone, R1881), {CPA} is bulkier in structure and therefore seemingly incompatible with the binding pockets observed in currently available x-ray crystal structures of the {AR} ligand-binding domain {(LBD).} We solved the x-ray crystal structure of the human {AR} {LBD} bound to {CPA} at {1.8A} in the {T877A} variant, a mutation known to increase the agonist activity of {CPA} and therefore facilitate purification and crystal formation of the receptor.drug complex. The structure demonstrates that bulk from the 17alpha-acetate group of {CPA} induces movement of the Leu-701 side chain, which results in partial unfolding of the C-terminal end of helix 11 and displacement of the loop between helices 11 and 12 in comparison to all other {AR} {LBD} crystal structures published to date. This structural alteration leads to an expansion of the {AR} binding cavity to include an additional pocket bordered by Leu-701, Leu-704, Ser-778, Met-780, Phe-876, and Leu-880. Further, we found that {CPA} invokes transcriptional activation in the {L701A} {AR} at low nanomolar concentrations similar to the {T877A} mutant. Analogous mutations in the glucocorticoid receptor {(GR)} and progesterone receptor were constructed, and we found that {CPA} was also converted into a potent agonist in the {M560A} {GR.} Altogether, these data offer information for structure-based drug design, elucidate flexible regions of the {AR} {LBD}, and provide insight as to how {CPA} antagonizes the {AR} and {GR.}},

This same {AR} mutation has been reported previously in a metastatic prostate cancer cell line, {LNCaP}, where this mutation confers upon the {AR} an altered ligand-binding specificity which is stimulated by estrogens, progestagens, and antiandrogens. It is possible that analogous to an activated/altered growth factor receptor oncogene, codon 877 mutant {AR} with altered ligand binding may provide a selective growth advantage in the genesis of a subset of advanced prostate cancer. Although estrogens are used infrequently, antiandrogens are used increasingly in hormonal therapy for patients with advanced prostate cancer. The stimulatory effect of these therapeutic agents on the codon 877 mutant {AR} further suggests that this frequently observed {AR} mutation may contribute to the treatment refractory disease.},

	abstract = {The mechanism by which the androgen receptor {(AR)} distinguishes between agonist and antagonist ligands is poorly understood. {AR} antagonists are currently used to treat prostate cancer. However, mutations commonly develop in patients that convert these compounds to agonists. Recently, our laboratory discovered selective androgen receptor modulators, which structurally resemble the nonsteroidal {AR} antagonists bicalutamide and hydroxyflutamide but act as agonists for the androgen receptor in a tissue-selective manner. To investigate why subtle structural changes to both the ligand and the receptor (i.e. mutations) result in drastic changes in activity, we studied structure-activity relationships for nonsteroidal {AR} ligands through crystallography and site-directed mutagenesis, comparing bound conformations of R-bicalutamide, hydroxyflutamide, and two previously reported nonsteroidal androgens, S-1 and R-3. These studies provide the first crystallographic evidence of the mechanism by which nonsteroidal ligands interact with the wild type {AR.} We have shown that changes induced to the positions of Trp-741, Thr-877, and Met-895 allow for ligand accommodation within the {AR} binding pocket and that a water-mediated hydrogen bond to the backbone oxygen of Leu-873 and the ketone of hydroxyflutamide is present when bound to the {T877A} {AR} variant. Additionally, we demonstrated that R-bicalutamide stimulates transcriptional activation in {AR} harboring the {M895T} point mutation. As a whole, these studies provide critical new insight for receptor-based drug design of nonsteroidal {AR} agonists and antagonists.},

	abstract = {The human prostate tumor cell line {LNCaP} contains an abnormal androgen receptor system with broad steroid binding specificity. Progestagens, estradiol and several antiandrogens compete with androgens for binding to the androgen receptor in the cells to a higher extent than in other androgen sensitive systems. Optimal growth of {LNCaP} cells is observed after addition of the synthetic androgen R1881 (0.1 {nM).} In addition, estrogens, progestagens and several antiandrogens do not inhibit androgen responsive growth, but have striking growth stimulatory effects and increase {EGF} receptor level and acid phosphatase secretion. We have found that the androgen receptor in the {LNCaP} cells contains a single point mutation changing the sense of codon 868 {(Thr} to Ala) in the ligand binding domain. Expression vectors containing the normal or mutated androgen receptor sequence were transfected into {COS} or {HeLa} cells. Androgens, progestagens, estrogens and several antiandrogens bind the mutated androgen receptor protein and activate the expression of an androgen-regulated reporter gene {(GRE-tk-CAT)}, indicating that the mutation directly affects both binding specificity and the induction of gene expression. Interestingly, the antiandrogen casodex showed antiandrogenic properties in growth studies of {LNCaP} cells and did not induce reporter gene activity in Hela cells transfected with the mutant receptor. The mutated androgen receptor of {LNCaP} cells is therefore a useful tool in the elucidation of different levels of action of steroids and antisteroids.},

	url = {http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10569618},
	abstract = {{PURPOSE}

We have characterized the androgen receptor {(AR)} in a new human prostate cancer cell line, {MDA} {PCa} 2a, that has recently been established from a bone metastasis of a patient whose cancer exhibited androgen-independent growth.


{MATERIALS} {AND} {METHODS}

Androgen responsiveness of these cells was assessed by measuring the effect of {DHT} and R1881 on cell growth and {PSA} secretion. Scatchard analysis was used to characterize the affinity and abundance of {AR} protein. Using a {PCR} based strategy, genomic {DNA} of the entire coding region of {AR} gene was sequenced to identify possible mutations.


{RESULTS}

These cells express abundant {AR} {(Nmax} = 685 +/- 149 fmol./mg. protein), but the {AR} binding affinity {(Kd)} for {DHT} is only 25 {nM}, approximately 50-fold lower affinity than the mutated {AR} in {LNCaP} prostate cancer cells {(Kd} = 0.5 {nM)} or the wildtype {AR} in {MCF-7} breast cancer cells {(Kd} = 0.4 {nM).} Two mutations, {L701H} and {T877A}, were identified in the ligand binding domain of the {AR} gene. Compared with {LNCaP} cells, the new cell line is significantly less responsive to {DHT} and R1881 as well as to other androgens such as testosterone, androstenedione, and {DHEA.} Similar to {LNCaP} cells, the ligand specificity of the {AR} in {MDA} {PCa} 2a cells appears to be relaxed and non-androgens such as progesterone and estradiol act as agonists although with less potency than in {LNCaP} cells. Interestingly, in the absence of androgens, the new cell line expresses 15-fold higher baseline levels of {PSA} than {LNCaP.}


{CONCLUSIONS}

Two mutations were identified in the {AR} gene of the {MDA} {PCa} 2a cell line that are likely responsible for the decreased androgen sensitivity and altered ligand specificity observed in these cells. Thus, this new cell line with partial androgen responsiveness and {PSA} expression can serve as a functionally relevant model system of bone metastatic prostate cancer, and can be used to investigate the role of {AR} mutations in prostate cancer and its progression to androgen independence.},

Inactivating mutations in {APC} have been reported in 34-70\% of sporadic colorectal cancer patients, the majority of which occur in the mutation cluster region {(MCR).} In this study, tumour tissue from 665 incident colorectal cancer patients, who originate from 120 852 men and women (55-69 years of age at baseline) participating in The Netherlands Cohort Study, was evaluated for the occurrence and type of {APC} mutations with regard to age at diagnosis, gender, family history of colorectal cancer, Dukes' stage, tumour differentiation and sub-localization. Mutation analysis of the {MCR}, which spans codons 1286-1513, was performed on archival adenocarcinoma samples using macrodissection, nested {PCR} and direct sequencing of purified {PCR} fragments. A large number of genetic aberrations (n = 978), including point mutations (n = 833), deletions (n = 126) and insertions (n = 19) was detected in the {MCR} in 72\% of patients (479/665). In particular, we observed a large number of missense mutations, more than reported previously. This may indicate involvement in colorectal carcinogenesis, although their significance for {APC} functions is unclear. Truncating mutations were found in 37\% of patients (248/665). Patients with rectosigmoid and rectum tumours relatively more frequently harboured C {\textgreater} T nonsense mutations and truncating frameshift mutations as compared with patients with proximal and distal colon tumours {(P} = 0.009 and P = 0.045, respectively). Differences in occurrence of truncating mutations with regard to tumour sub-localization suggest a different aetiology of tumourigenesis in colon and rectum.},

	abstract = {A method was developed for detecting the selective force at single amino acid sites given a multiple alignment of protein-coding sequences. The phylogenetic tree was reconstructed using the number of synonymous substitutions. Then, the neutrality was tested for each codon site using the numbers of synonymous and nonsynonymous changes throughout the phylogenetic tree. Computer simulation showed that this method accurately estimated the numbers of synonymous and nonsynonymous substitutions per site, as long as the substitution number on each branch was relatively small. The false-positive rate for detecting the selective force was generally low. On the other hand, the true-positive rate for detecting the selective force depended on the parameter values. Within the range of parameter values used in the simulation, the true-positive rate increased as the strength of the selective force and the total branch length (namely the total number of synonymous substitutions per site) in the phylogenetic tree increased. In particular, with the relative rate of nonsynonymous substitutions to synonymous substitutions being 5.0, most of the positively selected codon sites were correctly detected when the total branch length in the phylogenetic tree was {\textgreater} or = 2.5. When this method was applied to the human leukocyte antigen {(HLA)} gene, which included antigen recognition sites {(ARSs)}, positive selection was detected mainly on {ARSs.} This finding confirmed the effectiveness of the present method with actual data. Moreover, two amino acid sites were newly identified as positively selected in {non-ARSs.} The three-dimensional structure of the {HLA} molecule indicated that these sites might be involved in antigen recognition. Positively selected amino acid sites were also identified in the envelope protein of human immunodeficiency virus and the influenza virus hemagglutinin protein. This method may be helpful for predicting functions of amino acid sites in proteins, especially in the present situation, in which sequence data are accumulating at an enormous speed.},

	abstract = {Comparison of relative fixation rates of synonymous (silent) and nonsynonymous (amino acid-altering) mutations provides a means for understanding the mechanisms of molecular sequence evolution. The nonsynonymous/synonymous rate ratio (omega = {d(N)d(S))} is an important indicator of selective pressure at the protein level, with omega = 1 meaning neutral mutations, omega {\textless} 1 purifying selection, and omega {\textgreater} 1 diversifying positive selection. Amino acid sites in a protein are expected to be under different selective pressures and have different underlying omega ratios. We develop models that account for heterogeneous omega ratios among amino acid sites and apply them to phylogenetic analyses of protein-coding {DNA} sequences. These models are useful for testing for adaptive molecular evolution and identifying amino acid sites under diversifying selection. Ten data sets of genes from nuclear, mitochondrial, and viral genomes are analyzed to estimate the distributions of omega among sites. In all data sets analyzed, the selective pressure indicated by the omega ratio is found to be highly heterogeneous among sites. Previously unsuspected Darwinian selection is detected in several genes in which the average omega ratio across sites is {\textless}1, but in which some sites are clearly under diversifying selection with omega {\textgreater} 1. Genes undergoing positive selection include the beta-globin gene from vertebrates, mitochondrial protein-coding genes from hominoids, the hemagglutinin {(HA)} gene from human influenza virus A, and {HIV-1} env, vif, and pol genes. Tests for the presence of positively selected sites and their subsequent identification appear quite robust to the specific distributional form assumed for omega and can be achieved using any of several models we implement. However, we encountered difficulties in estimating the precise distribution of omega among sites from real data sets.},

     abstract = {Locally weighted regression, or loess, is a way of estimating a regression surface through a multivariate smoothing procedure, fitting a function of the independent variables locally and in a moving fashion analogous to how a moving average is computed for a time series. With local fitting we can estimate a much wider class of regression surfaces than with the usual classes of parametric functions, such as polynomials. The goal of this article is to show, through applications, how loess can be used for three purposes: data exploration, diagnostic checking of parametric models, and providing a nonparametric regression surface. Along the way, the following methodology is introduced: (a) a multivariate smoothing procedure that is an extension of univariate locally weighted regression; (b) statistical procedures that are analogous to those used in the least-squares fitting of parametric functions; (c) several graphical methods that are useful tools for understanding loess estimates and checking the assumptions on which the estimation procedure is based; and (d) the M plot, an adaptation of Mallow's C<sub>p</sub> procedure, which provides a graphical portrayal of the trade-off between variance and bias, and which can be used to choose the amount of smoothing.},

	abstract = {A large number of somatic mutations accumulate during the process of tumorigenesis. A subset of these mutations contribute to tumor progression (known as "driver" mutations) whereas the majority of these mutations are effectively neutral (known as "passenger" mutations). The ability to differentiate between drivers and passengers will be critical to the success of upcoming large-scale cancer {DNA} resequencing projects. Here we show a method capable of discriminating between drivers and passengers in the most frequently cancer-associated protein family, protein kinases. We apply this method to multiple cancer data sets, validating its accuracy by showing that it is capable of identifying known drivers, has excellent agreement with previous statistical estimates of the frequency of drivers, and provides strong evidence that predicted drivers are under positive selection by various sequence and structural analyses. Furthermore, we identify particular positions in protein kinases that seem to play a role in oncogenesis. Finally, we provide a ranked list of candidate driver mutations.},
